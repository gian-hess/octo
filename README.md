# octo
Final Project of my Propulsion Academy Full-Stack Bootcamp. Octo is a tournament Web-App for companies and individuals who want to organize and compete in sports tournaments.

The Project repository was done on Propulsions own instance of GitLab, thats why there are all the gitlab files for the CI/CD and Docker config. The result is live:
